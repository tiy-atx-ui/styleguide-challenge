        <h3>Oppose Drilling</h3>
        <p>As of today, 113 East Coast municipalities, more than 1,000 elected officials, and roughly 1,100 business interests have all publically opposed offshore drilling and/or seismic blasting, citing threats to marine life, coastal communities and local economies.

        <br>Drilling for oil and gas off North Carolina's coast presents significant risks with little reward. Help us tell our government that North Carolinians don't want offshore drilling off our beautiful, natural coast.</p>

        <h3>Save Solar Energy</h3>
        <p>The NC Secretary of Environmental Protection has unveiled a plan to hobble North Carolina's renewable energy industry. The proposals would halt North Carolina's commitment to renewable energy by creating unnecessary barriers to new solar installations and would gut the state's modest renewable energy program by declaring nuclear energy as a renewable resource.

        <br>Tell Gov. McCrory to demand that the head of his environmental agency cease its attack on North Carolina's important renewable energy industry.</p>

        <h3>Support Clean Air</h3>
        <p>Clean air is vital to human health and all the parts of our ecosystem. Most air pollutants come from manufacturing industries, vehicles and burning oil, gas or coal.

        <br>There is no regulation preventing companies from releasing toxic air pollution with no consequences. Send a message below and tell state officials to oppose this plan and to protect our clean air.</p>
